# IoT-V2E

PyTorch implementation on: IoT-V2E: an uncertainty-aware cross-modal hashing retrieval between infrared-videos and EEGs for automated sleep state analysi

## Introduction
we propose a novel IoT system (IoT-V2E) for monitoring and analysing sleep state at home using ubiquitous IR visual camera sensors. 

Specifically, IoT-V2E is a uncertainty-aware cross-modal hashing retrieval system that finds the most similar EEG signal representation in a database, rather than using a sleep stage classification paradigm, for sleep stage inference and analysis.
