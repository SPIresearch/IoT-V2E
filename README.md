# IoT-V2E

PyTorch implementation on: IoT-V2E: an uncertainty-aware cross-modal hashing retrieval between infrared-videos and EEGs for automated sleep state analysi

## Introduction
we propose a novel IoT system (IoT-V2E) for monitoring and analysing sleep state at home using ubiquitous IR visual camera sensors. 

Specifically, IoT-V2E is a uncertainty-aware cross-modal hashing retrieval system that finds the most similar EEG signal representation in a database, rather than using a sleep stage classification paradigm, for sleep stage inference and analysis.

###Trainï¼š
Run trainso.py  (single-GPU training)

You need to input some parameters based on your own settings, including hash code length, the location of the cross-modal dataset, and the location of generated hash codes, uncertainties, and checkpoints."
